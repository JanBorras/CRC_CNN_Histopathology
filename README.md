# CRC_CNN_Histopathology

__Final Master’s Project by Jan Borràs Ros__

This repository contains the code and resources for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify seven distinct tissue types in whole-slide images from colorectal cancer (CRC) biopsies, achieving an accuracy of approximately 96%.

The project is implemented in Python using the (https://github.com/fastai/fastai)[FastAI]
 and (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)[PyTorch] frameworks. To run the provided scripts, please ensure that FastAI, PyTorch, and their dependencies are properly installed. We recommend using a Jupyter Notebook environment for executing the scripts.

You can access the full project report (in Catalan) here: (https://openaccess.uoc.edu/items/233b3a79-1898-44ed-b553-c3910f5b5c7c/full)[Final Report]

## Usage

Download the dataset used to train the CNN from (https://zenodo.org/records/53169#.XB0hr8Yo9wE)[Zenodo]

Install the required dependencies.

Launch a Jupyter Notebook session within the FastAI environment.

Update all file paths in the scripts to match your local directory structure.
